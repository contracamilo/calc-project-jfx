To run the .jar you'll need to have installed the JavaFx runtime installed.

For this activity, we will develop an algorithm in JAVA that allows us to create a calculator with basic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, factorial) using all the fundamental concepts covered in the previous unit. Please note that our focus will be on the algorithm's logic rather than the graphical aspect of the program.

As a 'bonus,' you can add an unspecified operation to the calculator. This option is not mandatory but will give you an advantage in the final grade for the workshop as long as it functions correctly.

Format: JAVA

Development: Individual

Deliverable: Project with the source code and executable file compressed in a ZIP archive.
